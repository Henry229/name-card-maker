# Project Title

Name Card Maker

## Description

• It's the first project using Database while learning React.

• The reason why I started this project 
  - I was wondering how to get data from DB while making front-end pages.
  - I didn't like pretending to get data by using like 'setTimeout()'.
  - I was wondering how to use Firebase.
  
• Things I implemented
  - Create and update data in firebase DB. 
  - Get the data you want to find like using 'select' in Mysql.
  - Authentication in Firebase.
  - the way using props in child components.
